 For my final year electronics project, I developed a dual-axis solar tracking system that 
combines the Firefly Algorithm (FA) with an optimized PID controller to improve the 
efficiency and accuracy of solar power generation. The Research is contributing to the 
proof that complex control systems can be created and used in real-world scenarios. It 
demonstrated abilities including collaboration, report writing, and presentation skills, 
among others.
